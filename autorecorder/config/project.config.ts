 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 1 of 3
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Who this project is: which CopilotKit integration it tests, where its docs
 * live, and how its three services are reached and started.
 *
 * Everything else derives from this. Doc and demo URLs are built from
 * `docBaseUrl` and `frontendUrl`, so a page never repeats them and no page can
 * point at a different framework's docs by accident.
 *
 * `npm run doctor` rejects any field still set to REPLACE_ME, so a half-done
 * adaptation cannot pass as finished.
 *
 * ── Three services, not two ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Angular has no server route to host the Copilot Runtime the way a Next app
 * does, so the runtime is its own Node process (`frontend/server.ts`) sitting
 * between `ng serve` and the DeepAgents graph. That is why `runtimeWarmPath`
 * below is an absolute URL rather than a path under `frontendUrl`: the browser
 * posts across origins to reach it.

  // This repo's defaults collided with its neighbours: `ng serve` on 4200 and
  // the runtime on 8200 are both already taken by Agno-angular, and 8200 is
  // additionally MsPy-angular's backend. Angular and the runtime therefore
  // moved to 4203 / 8203 so all four stacks can run at once. The langgraph dev
  // server keeps 8123, which nothing else uses.
  //
  // Moving the runtime means moving it in two places -- `PORT` for
  // frontend/server.ts, and `runtimeUrl` in frontend/src/app/app.config.ts,
  // which hardcodes the URL the browser posts to.
  frontendUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:4203',

  // Not a FastAPI app. `backend/main.py` exports a graph and
  // `backend/langgraph.json` publishes it as `sample_agent`; serving it is the
  // langgraph dev server's job. That server answers `/ok`, not `/health` or
  // `/openapi.json`, and it is what frontend/src/app/components/backend-health.ts
  // probes too -- so both halves of the repo agree on what "the backend is up"
  // means.

  // dev` hot-reloads on any change under the repo, and the recorder writes into
  // the repo while it works -- frontend/VERSIONS.md before every doctor run,
  // clips and RECORD_RESULTS.json into autorecorder/videos/. The watcher sees
  // those, reloads, and eventually exits mid-suite, which surfaces as pages
  // failing with "the agent never replied" for no visible reason.
