/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 3 of 3
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * One entry per doc page, in the order the doc nav lists them.
 *
 * Entries are deliberately short. `docUrl`, `demoUrl` and the output filename
 * are derived from `project.config.ts` plus the fields below, so no entry can
 * point at the wrong framework's docs and filenames stay in nav order without
 * anyone numbering them by hand.
 *
 * Everything here mirrors `frontend/src/app/lib/nav-config.ts`, the app's own
 * source of truth for route -> doc-page mapping. `docPath` is that file's
 * `docPath` minus its leading `/angular/deepagents`. Four routes (threads,
 * memory, attachments, headless) repeat one `docPath` because the Angular docs
 * cover all four topics on a single page — that is the doc's shape, not a
 * copy/paste slip.
 *
 * ── Scope ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `route` + `demoSuffix` is the only demo URL a page can have, and the doctor
 * errors on any that is not 200. The app's nav lists 13 routes; `/` (the
 * landing page) and `/doc-sync` have no `hasDemo`, and `/status` is app
 * furniture rather than a doc page. The other 11 are all here.
 *
 * The numbering that results — a2ui at 04, memory at 09 — is the same
 * numbering the Angular sibling repos reserve empty slots for, so a
 * DAPY-angular clip and its MSPY-angular counterpart carry the same index for
 * the same guide. Do not reorder without checking those.
 *
 * `inspector` is the one entry deliberately out of nav order. The doc nav puts
 * it in Getting Started, right after the quickstart step that links to it, and
 * `frontend/src/app/lib/nav-config.ts` places it there. Here it is last,
 * because slotting it in at position 3 would renumber every clip after it and
 * break that cross-repo index agreement for a page the siblings have no
 * counterpart for. Order in this file only decides a filename index.
 *
 * ── The line ranges ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `startLine`/`endLine` are what the simulated IDE highlights. Unlike the
 * sibling Angular repos, this frontend brackets nothing: there are no
 * `[!code highlight]`, `#region`, or `// <topic> : <snippet> start|end`
 * markers anywhere under `src/app/features/`. Every range below was therefore
 * read off the file by hand, and `npm run doctor` can only prove a range is
 * in-bounds — not that it still frames the code the page is about.
 *
 * **Re-read them after editing any feature component.** Teaching the doctor a
 * marker syntax would restore the guard, but this repo would have to grow the
 * markers first.
 *
 * ── `knownIssue` ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This repo is not only documenting an integration that works. Four of the
 * pages below are on the QA report as broken, and their clips exist to show
 * that. `knownIssue` is what makes the run say `[ISSUE]` rather than `[PASS]`,
 * and it is the same object `ci/build-report.mjs` renders into the daily
 * report — so the sentence typed on screen and the row that goes to the
 * manager are one string, written here, once.
 *
 * A page whose defect gets fixed upstream should have its `knownIssue` deleted
 * in the same change that confirms the fix. Leaving a stale one behind is
 * worse than having none: the clip keeps asserting a bug that is gone.
