/**
 * A2UI — enabled on the runtime, inert in the browser, and the recording says so.
 *
 * https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/deepagents/guides/a2ui
 *
 * `a2ui: {}` in frontend/server.ts turns the middleware on and `/info` duly
 * reports `a2uiEnabled: true`. What actually registers the `render_a2ui`
 * renderer is supplying `a2ui.catalog` to provideCopilotKit — and the guide's
 * catalog snippet is not self-contained, so none is supplied. The agent answers
 * in prose and no declarative UI appears.
 *
 * ── Why this take is adaptive ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The QA report describes this as a "catalog not found" error, and the React
 * sibling repo reproduces it as a console error naming a specific URL
 * (`Catalog not found: https://a2ui.org/specification/v0_9/basic_catalog.json`).
 * This repo's own README describes something subtly different: A2UI that is
 * silently *inert*, with no error at all.
 *
 * Those are two different failures and they need two different videos. A
 * console error must be shown in a console, or the clip is a chat that sits
 * there doing nothing — indistinguishable on video from a slow model. A silent
 * no-op has no console to open, and opening an empty one would imply the error
 * exists when it does not.
 *
 * So the handler captures the console, asks for a surface, and then films
 * whichever failure actually happened. It does not decide in advance which
 * report is right, because both were written by people looking at different
 * builds.
